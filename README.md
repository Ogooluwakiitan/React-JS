<!-- Question 5 -->
1. In HTML, multiple elements can be returned while Nested JSX must return one element, which we’ll call a parent element that wraps all other levels of nested elements.
2. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element while in JSX You can’t use the word class to define HTML classes, since class is a reserved word in JavaScript, instead, use — className.
